<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Airport Biometric Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact</li><li>Contactless</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Airport Biometric market consists of two main types: contact and contactless. Contact biometric systems require physical contact with a sensor, such as fingerprint or iris recognition. This type offers high accuracy but may raise hygiene concerns. Contactless biometric systems, on the other hand, do not require physical contact, utilizing technologies like facial recognition or hand gesture recognition. This type provides a more convenient and hygienic experience for users, although it may have slightly lower accuracy compared to contact systems.</p></p>
