<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Glaucoma Surgery Therapies Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Laser Treatment</li><li>Incision Surgery</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Glaucoma surgery therapies include laser treatment and incision surgery. Laser treatment involves using a high-energy beam of light to open blocked drainage canals and reduce intraocular pressure. This procedure is relatively quick and minimally invasive. On the other hand, incision surgery involves creating a new drainage channel in the eye to improve fluid flow and reduce pressure. This more traditional approach may require a longer recovery time but can effectively treat glaucoma in some cases. Both types of surgeries aim to prevent vision loss and manage the progression of glaucoma.</p></p>
