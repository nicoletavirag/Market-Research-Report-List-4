<p><strong>The Piezoelectric Drivers Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Loop Control</li><li>Closed Loop Control</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Piezoelectric drivers are used in both open loop control and closed loop control applications. In open loop control, the driver sends a voltage signal directly to the piezoelectric device without any feedback mechanism. This is suitable for simple tasks where precise positioning is not critical. In closed loop control, the driver adjusts the voltage signal based on feedback from the piezoelectric device, allowing for more accurate and precise control in applications such as nanomanipulation and high-precision positioning.</p></p>
