<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solar Storage Tank Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Wall</li><li>Double Wall</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Solar storage tanks are categorized into two main types: single wall and double wall tanks. Single wall tanks are simpler in design consisting of a single layer of material, typically made of steel or glass-lined steel. These tanks are less expensive but offer less protection against leaks and corrosion. On the other hand, double wall tanks have an additional layer of material for increased durability and protection against leaks. They are more secure but come at a higher cost compared to single wall tanks.</p></p>
