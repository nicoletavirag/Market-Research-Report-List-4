<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Animal Isolator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Pressure Isolator</li><li>Negative Pressure Isolator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Positive pressure isolators and negative pressure isolators are both types of animal isolators used in laboratory research settings. Positive pressure isolators create a clean, controlled environment by keeping contaminants out with a higher internal pressure than the surrounding area. On the other hand, negative pressure isolators use lower internal pressure to prevent the escape of pathogens from the isolator. Both types of isolators are crucial for maintaining the health and safety of research animals and preventing cross-contamination in laboratory experiments.</p></p>
