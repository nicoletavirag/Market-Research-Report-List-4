<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hand-held Tonometer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Type</li><li>Non-contact Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hand-held tonometers are devices used to measure intraocular pressure in the eye. There are two main types of hand-held tonometers on the market - contact type and non-contact type. Contact type tonometers require physical contact with the eye to measure pressure, while non-contact tonometers use a puff of air to measure pressure without touching the eye. Both types have their own advantages and disadvantages, with contact tonometers providing more accurate readings but potentially causing discomfort, while non-contact tonometers are easier to use but may be less precise.</p></p>
