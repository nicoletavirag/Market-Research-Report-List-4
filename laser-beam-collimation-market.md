<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Laser Beam Collimation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Reflective Collimators</li><li>Refractive Collimators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Laser beam collimation market comprises two main types, reflective collimators and refractive collimators. Reflective collimators use mirrors to redirect and focus the laser beam, while refractive collimators use lenses to achieve the same effect. Reflective collimators are often preferred for their high precision and efficiency in applications requiring a narrow, focused beam. In contrast, refractive collimators are more commonly used for their simplicity and lower cost, making them suitable for less demanding applications where precision is not critical.</p></p>
