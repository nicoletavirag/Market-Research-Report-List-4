<p><ul><li>Hydrophilic Anti-fog</li><li>Hydrophobic Anti-fog</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Anti-fog paint is available in two main types: hydrophilic and hydrophobic. Hydrophilic anti-fog paint works by attracting moisture to the surface of the paint, where it forms a thin film that prevents fogging. On the other hand, hydrophobic anti-fog paint repels moisture, creating a surface that remains clear and fog-free. Both types offer effective solutions for preventing fogging on various surfaces, such as mirrors, windows, and eyewear, providing clarity and visibility in humid environments.</p></p>
