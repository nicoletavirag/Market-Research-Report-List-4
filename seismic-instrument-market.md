<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Seismic Instrument Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Short Period Seismograph</li><li>Long Period Seismograph</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Short period seismographs are designed to measure high-frequency seismic waves, typically used to monitor local or regional seismic activity. They are more sensitive to smaller earthquakes and provide detailed data on ground motion. Long period seismographs, on the other hand, are built to measure low-frequency seismic waves, often used for monitoring distant earthquakes or volcanic activity. These instruments are less sensitive to smaller tremors but can detect large earthquakes occurring far away. Both types play crucial roles in seismology and earthquake monitoring.</p></p>
