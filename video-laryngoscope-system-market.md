<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Video Laryngoscope System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Un-Channelled Video Laryngoscopes</li><li>Channelled Video Laryngoscopes</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Video laryngoscopes are classified into two main types based on the design of the blade: Un-Channelled Video Laryngoscopes and Channelled Video Laryngoscopes. Un-Channelled video laryngoscopes have a straight blade without a guiding channel for endotracheal tube insertion, allowing for a direct view of the vocal cords. On the other hand, Channelled video laryngoscopes have a built-in guide or groove on the blade that assists in guiding the endotracheal tube into the trachea during intubation. Both types have their own advantages and are used based on the preference of the healthcare provider.</p></p>
