<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Beam Smoke Detectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Reflective</li><li>Projected</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Beam smoke detectors are devices used for smoke detection in large open spaces such as warehouses, atriums, and shopping malls. There are two main types of beam smoke detectors - reflective and projected. Reflective beam smoke detectors emit a beam of light that is reflected back to the detector, while projected beam smoke detectors emit a beam of light across a space to a receiver. Both types are effective in detecting smoke particles in the air and are commonly used in commercial and industrial settings. The global market for beam smoke detectors is expected to grow steadily, driven by increasing safety regulations and the need for advanced fire detection systems.</p></p>
