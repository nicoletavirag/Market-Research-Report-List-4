<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automatic Continuous Variable Transmission Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Belt Connection</li><li>Chain Connection</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automatic Continuous Variable Transmission (CVT) systems come in two main types: Belt Connection and Chain Connection. In a Belt Connection CVT, power is transferred between two pulleys using a flexible belt made of rubber or metal. This system is commonly found in passenger cars and offers smooth acceleration. On the other hand, Chain Connection CVT uses a metal chain to transfer power between pulleys, providing higher torque capacity and durability. This type of CVT is often used in heavy-duty vehicles such as trucks and buses. Both types of CVT aim to provide seamless and efficient power delivery.</p></p>
