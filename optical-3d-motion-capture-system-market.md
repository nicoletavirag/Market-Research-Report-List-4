<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Optical 3D Motion Capture System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Type</li><li>Passive Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Optical 3D motion capture systems can be divided into two main types: active and passive. Active systems use sources of light, such as LEDs, to track the movement of reflective markers placed on the subject. These systems require the markers to emit light in order to be detected by the cameras. Passive systems, on the other hand, do not require markers to emit light and instead rely on the reflection of ambient light or specialized markers for tracking. Each type has its own advantages and limitations depending on the specific application.</p></p>
