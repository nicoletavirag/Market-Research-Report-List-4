<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial Handheld 3D Scanner Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Laser</li><li>Structure Light</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Industrial handheld 3D scanners are available in two main types: laser scanners and structured light scanners. Laser scanners use laser beams to capture 3D data by measuring distance to an object, making them ideal for precise and detailed scanning. On the other hand, structured light scanners project a pattern of light onto an object and use cameras to capture the deformation of the pattern, making them faster but less accurate than laser scanners. Both types cater to different needs and applications in the industrial sector.</p></p>
